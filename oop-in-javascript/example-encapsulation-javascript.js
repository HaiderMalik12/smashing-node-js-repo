/*
Best Object Creation Pattern is
-Combination Constructor/Protortype Pattern
-
-when you want to create car ,suzuki car stuff like that
-
-Each User will have a name ,score,email
-
-We want all the user objects to have these same properties and
-methods ,
-We can not achive this by using literal way
-We need to make a constructor function
-encapsulate theses properties and methods
